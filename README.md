# openHABScripts
This is a library for the JSR223 scripting engine on openHAB.

The goal of this project is to make the scripting with jython easier and less prone to errors.

#Usage
- Add ```"-Dpython.path="configurations/scripts/lib""``` to the java args of openhab
- Copy the ```lib``` folder to ```configurations/scripts``` so all the files are in ```.../scripts/lib/```
- Create a new (Switch) item "Initialize" (name can be configured).
```
Switch Initialize "Initialize"
````

- When creating a new script start with
```python
import ScriptHelper as SH
helper = SH.ScriptHelper( "ModuleName")
```

- When creating a new rule do the following:
```python
class MyJSR223RuleName(SH.EasyRule):
    def __init__(self):
        #add this line or the lib won't work
        SH.EasyRule.__init__(self, helper)
        
        #define your variables here
        self.__myvariable = 0
    def Initialize(self):
        #initialize all your variables and required states here
        self.__myvariable = 0

#create an instance of the rule
#Note: this is different! Creating an instance is enough!
MyJSR223RuleName()
```
- At the End of the file do the following
```python
def getRules():
    return RuleSet(helper.GetRules() + [
        MyLegacyrule()
    ])
```
Note that all the rules with instances are automatically added.



#Why should I use this library?
- It prints all the added rules in the logger window.
This makes searching for errors really easy.

- It checks whether you have defined valid rule triggers:

````
- It makes initializing rule variables very easy!
Just Drag and Drop the new Rule into the folder and the Initialize functions are called.
It even works during startup.
- Possibility to set openHAB back to a defined state.
Just change the initialization item to ON and everything will be as it is supposed to be.
No more posting states to items or calling functions manually.
One click/post and everything is like after startup.
